<h1>subdomain enumeration</h1>

<h3>Discover your subdomains to see what may fall under the crosshairs of attackers!</h3>

<p>Looking for your organisation's subdomains is crucial to understanding your level of exposure in the digital world. We often fall under the illusion that attackers will only attempt to enter through one point (e.g. the main website) to penetrate inside an organisation. This is not always the case... they will often try the easy way out (such as sending a phishing e-mail or going through a forgotten subdomain! ).</p><p>One of the main threats of subdomains is that they are often abandoned but not decommissioned, leading to exposure on the Internet with outdated software. This tool allows domain administrators to find them and decide what to do with them.
